Hi there! 👋 I'm Vladyslav

🎓 I'm 21 years old, originally from Ukraine, and currently studying in Germany at Technische Hochschule Ulm, where I'm in my 6th semester. My main focus is software development, and I primarily work with Java, Spring Boot, ReactJS, and RestAPI.

💻 I strive for efficiency and readability in my code, and I enjoy tackling complex challenges and learning new things. Here are a few of my recent projects:

🚀 Projects:

🛒 Online Store in Java: Developed using servlets and MySQL. This was one of my first projects where I learned the basics of web development and database management.

🛍️ Online Store with Spring Boot + Thymeleaf: This project allowed me to dive deeper into Spring Boot and the Thymeleaf templating engine, creating more complex and dynamic web applications.

📸 Instagram Clone with Spring Boot + ReactJS + Tailwind + MUI: My latest and most extensive project, featuring:

User registration and authentication with JWT tokens and email verification.

Online chat with message encryption using WebSocket.

Photo and video storage in cloud storage.

Core social network features: posting, liking, commenting, and more.


🛠️ Technologies and Tools:

Backend: Java, Spring Boot, MySQL

Frontend: ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, MUI

DevOps: Docker, Git

💡 I'm always open to new projects and collaborations. If you have any interesting ideas or proposals, feel free to reach out!
